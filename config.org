* TODOs
** TODO This repo is currently only a fragment of my emacs config

* Core package initialization

#+name: init-core-package
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
	       '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))
#+end_src

I am going to be using ~use-package~ to install _all_ packages. It
will likely be used for package configuration as well.
#+name: init-use-package
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src

* Core configuration (better defaults)

These section will contain (hopefully) all changes that I make to
/default/ emacs to make it feel cozier.

Ewww, mouse-based UI elements! Bye.
#+better-defaults
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

I am going to default ~fringe-mode~ to off because I am not yet
putting it to use. It does seem interesting, and I will probably
enable it when I find a better use for it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (fringe-mode -1)
#+end_src

Enabling ~electric-pair-mode~ at the global level until it becomes
annoying. I may restrict this to programming modes only.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (electric-pair-mode 1)
#+end_src

Using this until I add in my vertico config stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (fido-mode 1)
  (fido-vertical-mode 1)
#+end_src

* Project management

https://magit.vc/

Using [[https://magit.vc/][magit]] for all of my git needs!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit)
#+end_src

* Key bindings

For now, all of my key bindings will be here... this might go out of
control -- we'll see.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (keymap-global-set "M-o" 'other-window)  
#+end_src

* Theme

I want /all/ of my theme stuff to be located here, with the exception
of some basic core configuration located above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-theme 'tsdh-dark)
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 210)
  (toggle-frame-maximized)    
#+end_src
